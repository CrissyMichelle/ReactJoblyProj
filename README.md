- Frontend: React, Create-React-App
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Setup and Installation
### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository from github
2. Navigate to backend and install dependencies
3. Start the backend server
4. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend and install dependencies
5. Start the React development server

## Project Status and Future Plans
- As part of the Springboard Software Engineering Career Course online bootcamp, React-Jobly offers students practice with full-stack development before commencing with their final Capstone project and graduation from the course.
- My future plans include building an UberEats style app using similar technologies, graduating Springboard, and pursuing the latest Java SE certification.
